# VIPER

**VIPER** is an open-source software tool for the analysis of captured velocity time series. VIPER stand for **V**elocity time-series **i**nspection, **p**ost-processing and **er**ror filtering tool and contains a collection of most common, best-practice methods used for velocity time series evaluation.


## System requirements

When using from Matlab, VIPER requires pwelch.m for computing Welch's spectrum:
- either pwelch.m provided by Mathworks (e.g. Signal Processing Toolbox) 
- or a 3rd-patry pwelch function (e.g. pwelch.m written by Peter V. Lanspeary)

When using as executable, VIPER requires installed Matlab Runtime of Version specified in the release
